**Taking over ongoing maintenance of Guelph's addresses — announcement**

@ARandomThumbtack has given me the go-ahead to pick up ongoing upkeep of Guelph's addresses. Thanks to them for the 2025 import — it put Guelph among the two best-covered municipalities in Ontario — and for the handover.

Three things, all documented at **<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Guelph/Import/AddressPoints>**:

**1. Continuous gap-fill.** 2,523 of 40,634 City addresses aren't in OSM (measured 2026-08-10) — the tail parked in `RemainingAddresses.osm`, plus everything published since, like the 51 addresses the City added on 2026-08-06. I track the City dataset with a differ; when it changes I re-conflate, hand-review the new candidates and upload one changeset per area. Create-only, every candidate approved by a human, `import=yes` / `bot=no`. Same tooling and same dedicated account as the [Toronto import](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Toronto/Import/AddressPoints) in May.

**2. Removing `addr:province=Ontario`** from the ~3,699 Guelph objects that carry it. Canadian convention omits province; the Toronto import doesn't write it.

**3. Normalising unit tagging.** 5,422 objects encode the unit twice — `addr:housenumber=714-30` *and* `addr:unit=30` — in an order that isn't even the Canada Post one. Splitting to `addr:housenumber=714` + `addr:unit=30`.

@ARandomThumbtack and I have gone back and forth on (3). For the record: I tested against live Nominatim on 2026-08-21, and unit-level search fails under *every* tagging scheme — "72 York Road Unit 5" returns the property with the unit ignored. So searchability doesn't argue for the combined form, while the combined form does break plain "714 Willow Road" queries, because then nothing carries the bare civic number.

**Also withdrawing the `addr:full` suggestion in my post above** — same test, Nominatim discards `addr:full` outright. It buys nothing. Ignore that part.

(2) and (3) are mechanical edits under the [Automated Edits code of conduct](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct): documented on the wiki page, run neighbourhood by neighbourhood in separately revertable batches, no other tags touched.

**Objections welcome for 14 days, to 2026-09-10.** Then a pilot tile posted here with its counts and changeset before anything else moves.
